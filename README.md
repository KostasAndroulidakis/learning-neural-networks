# Learning Neural Networks

This repository contains implementations of neural networks from first principles in Python, C++, and Rust. No external machine learning libraries.

## Purpose

1. **Educational**: Understand core concepts by implementing from scratch
2. **Comparative**: See how the same algorithms translate across languages
3. **Performance**: Analyze efficiency differences between implementations

## Current Status

- **Work in progress**. Building fundamental components before more complex architectures.
- Starting with Perceptrons and gradually moving to more complex structures.

## Structure

```
learning-neural-networks/
├── python/       # Python implementations
├── cpp/          # C++ implementations
├── rust/         # Rust implementations
```

Each language section follows similar patterns but leverages language-specific idioms for optimal implementation.

## Key Focus

- Mathematical correctness
- Clean, efficient code
- Detailed documentation
- Performance benchmarks

## Roadmap

1. Single-neuron models (Perceptron)
2. Multi-layer networks
3. Training algorithms
4. Optimization techniques

Contributions welcome.
